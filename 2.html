  <h2>VALUES</h2><p>My first values is constant challenge. I think Only challenge can to be change the world. Second, communication to heaven and earth.
Communication has amazingly power. That makes HUMAN revolution, I think. Third, Trust. No trust, No world. Human between Human necessarily need trust.
Last, honest. If a person don't do work be honest, I fired rigth then. Honest is the most important thing to me.
